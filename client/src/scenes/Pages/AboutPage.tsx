        Natalie Kuklin is an artist originally from Ukraine. She was born into a
        very poor family with a brother and sister. All of them became orphans
        at an early age, but even this could not stop Natalia on her way to
        beauty. From early childhood, she independently studied various painting
        techniques that were only available to her, devoting almost all her free
        time to this. That is how she learned to turn every drop of paint on
        every square centimeter of canvas into art. Even the war, partial
        occupation and constant rocket attacks did not stop Natalya on the way
        to her dream - to give people amazing paintings that will go down in
        history. Although Natalie creates artwork of different styles, her
        website is dedicated mostly to both modern abstract painting in fluid
        art and traditional acrylic painting styles. According to the artist,
        her paintings are more than fine art because they carry positive energy
        that is coded in symbolic decor elements. Abstract painting arose out of
        a folk art which was believed to have the magical power to protect from
        sorrow. Depictions of certain elements such as birds and flowers
        represented prosperity, harmony, and happiness. When creating decorative
        art, Natalie Kuklin dedicates her time to the extension of conventional
        boundaries by incorporation of techniques and styles of the past,
        adapting them to the trends and materials of the present. Balanced
        colorful compositions with attention to small details combined with
        sophistication, tell the viewer about the artist's self-expression,
        creativity, and aesthetic taste.
