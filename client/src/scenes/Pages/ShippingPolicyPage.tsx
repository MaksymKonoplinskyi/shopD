      <h4>Original Art Pieces</h4>
      <p>
        A shipping and packaging invoice will be sent after purchase of original
        art pieces. You can request an estimate before purchase by sending the
        size of the piece and full address to nataliekuklinart@gmail.com. All
        original paintings are final so we do recommend getting an estimate
        beforehand. We ship original paintings worldwide.

      <h4>How do I check the status of my order?</h4>
      <p>
        When your order has shipped, you will receive an email notification from
        us which will include a tracking number you can use to check its status.
        If you havenâ€™t received your order within 30 days of receiving your
        tracking number, please contact us at nataliekuklinart@gmail.com with
        your name and order number, and we will look into it for you.
