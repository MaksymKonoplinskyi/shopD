      <h4>14-day cooling off period</h4>
      <p>
        You have the right to cancel or return your order within 14 days, for
        any reason and without a justification. Your item must be in the same
        condition that you received it.
      </p>
      <h4>Damages and issues</h4>
      <p>
        Please inspect your order upon reception and contact us immediately if
        the item is defective, or damaged or if you receive the wrong item so
        that we can evaluate the issue and make it right.
      </p>
      <h4>Exceptions / non-returnable items</h4>
      <p>
        Certain types of items cannot be returned, like original art pieces or
        custom products (such as commissions). Please get in touch if you have
        questions or concerns about your specific item. Unfortunately, we cannot
        accept returns on sale items or gift cards.
      </p>
      <h4>Refunds</h4>
      <p>
        We will notify you once we’ve received and inspected your return, and
        let you know if the refund was approved or not. If approved, you’ll be
        automatically refunded on your original payment method within 10
        business days. Please remember it can take some time for your bank or
        credit card company to process and post the refund too. If more than 15
        business days have passed since we approved your return, please contact
        us at hello@victoriarosepark.com.
